### Objective

Using TypeScript and Angular and TailwindCSS, to build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

Your task is to build out the project corresponding to the [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/uZubtaHZj6q7Y7mIBsLICA/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A3&mode=design&t=VKObA0tOqB21NAft-1). You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to along with active states.

Will find all the required assets in the `/src/assets/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in JPG static format.

This project should use TailwindCSS to build the page.

### Deliverables

Include all source code in the repository.
Able to running to test with command "ng test --code-coverage" to show the overall sumarry
