### Objective

Using TypeScript and Angular and TailwindCSS, your challenge is to build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty

Your task is to build out the project corresponding to the [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/uZubtaHZj6q7Y7mIBsLICA/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A3&mode=design&t=VKObA0tOqB21NAft-1). You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to along with active states.

You will find all the required assets in the `/src/assets/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in JPG static format.

This project should use TailwindCSS to build the page.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **TypeScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Closing Words

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!**
